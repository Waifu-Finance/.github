**Waifu Finance** aims to simplify the execution of omnichain yield strategies and enhance the overall user experience (UX/UI) for non-advanced crypto users. 
Drawing inspiration from platforms like Beefy and Yearn, we identified a gap in the market concerning yield optimization. 
With the rise of Restaking and RWA in the crypto space, the creation of an Omnichain Yield Product powered by AI-agents can:

- Enhance the UX/UI for consumers.
- Introduce new, innovative yield strategies not yet seen in the autocompounder market.

### Issues

In the current iteration of autocompounders, several challenges exist:

1. **Lack of Network Agnosticism (A):** Users may not have funds on the respective chain they wish to farm on if the yield is high, potentially forcing them to leave the app, bridge, and obtain the necessary tokens.

2. **Zapping Function Requirement (B):** Users are compelled to leave the platform to acquire the LP token required to execute the strategy if the zapping function is not implemented.

3. **Retail User Gatekeeping (C):** Retail users with low capital are gated from ETH/mainnet yield opportunities due to gas fees, hindering accessibility to these financial tools.

One caveat is that mainnet vaults may have higher fees to cover the costs of gas required for specific strategies.

### How Waifu Finance Solves This

**Waifu Finance** addresses these challenges by leveraging Autonloas, which has created on-chain agents capable of interacting with deployed smart contract ABIs. 
Following a similar design pattern as Yearn, we design strategies tailored towards EigenLayer (and RWA once we've made our mark in the LSD Market). 
Utilizing AI agents, we can employ omnichain infrastructure like Stargate or Hyperlane to transfer user funds to any chain, extracting yield from EigenLayer AVS' and restaking protocols such as Swell, Restake, Puffer, etc.
